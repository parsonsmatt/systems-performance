# what is performance?

Note:

Alright, so this talk is about performance!
I want to talk about how we're making our systems faster at Seller Labs.
Ultimately, it comes down to a pretty basic set of techniques and tools.
First, we must understand what performance actually is!

Note:

We gotta go fast.
That's part of it -- how fast can our system operate?
Or, to put it another way, how much time does our system take?


<!-- .slide: data-background="fat-sonic.gif" -->

Note:

Another aspect to performance is size.
How big does our system need to be to handle a given load?
Or, to put it another way, as our problems get bigger, how fast do we need to consume more resouces?

Note:

Yet another aspect to performance is complexity.
How difficult is the process, how expensive is it, and how likely is it to fail?
Or, to put it another way, is it worth it to use some technique to make a system faster?


# performance

is complicated

Note:

So performance has a ton of questions.
It's not just about going faster and faster until you're awesome like Sonic.
How do we answer these questions?


### science!!!!

Note:

The answer, of course, is to use science.
The scientific method is crucial when you need to improve the performance of a system.
Let's review how science gets done!


how do science

1. measure what you care about <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. try one thing <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <span class="fragment">(ONLY ONE)</span>
3. measure again <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. conclusion??? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

This is the basis of science.
First, you measure the thing you care about.
Then, you try one thing.
ONLY ONE!
If you try multiple things, then you have no idea which of them actually made a difference!
Finally, measure again.
Then, you've gathered some kind of evidence that the thing you tried maybe had some effect.

This is really easy to do wrong.
It's almost impossible to only measure one change, because the entire world is constantly changing.
But if we do this, and stick to this method, then we can build awesome stuff together!
